# JuliaPsychometrics

The aim of the JuliaPsychometrics organization is to provide a consistent and coherent ecosystem for psychometric modeling.
It offers a collection of performance optimized tools:
- unified APIs to provide a "common ground" for a consistent experience in developing and applying tools for psychometric modeling
- implementation of concrete psychometric methods for developing, estimating and testing a wide range of models (e.g. Rasch Models)
- pre-defined, yet highly extandable visualization packages providing publication-ready plots (e.g. expected score plots, ICCs, IICs)
