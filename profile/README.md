# JuliaPsychometrics

The aim of the JuliaPsychometrics organization is to provide a consistent and coherent ecosystem for psychometric modeling.
It offers a collection of performance optimized tools:
- unified APIs to provide a "common ground" for a consistent experience in developing and applying tools for psychometric modeling
- implementation of concrete psychometric methods for developing, estimating and testing a wide range of models (e.g. Rasch Models)
- pre-defined, yet highly extandable visualization packages providing publication-ready plots (e.g. expected score plots, ICCs, IICs)

The currently developed packages are:

- [AbstractItemResponseModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPsychometrics/AbstractItemResponseModels.jl): A package providing an abstract interface for item response modeling.
- [RaschModels.jl (public soon)](https://github.com/JuliaPsychometrics/RaschModels.jl): A modeling package combining frequentist an bayesian methods for estimating and testing the following item response models: Rasch Model and LLTM for dichotomous data, (Linear) Partial Credit and (Linear) Rating Scale Model for polytomous data.
- [ItemResponsePlots.jl (public soon)](https://github.com/JuliaPsychometrics/ItemResponsePlots.jl): A plotting package for item response models based on [Makie.jl](https://docs.makie.org/stable/). Includes item characteristic curves, item information curves, expected score plots, and test information plots.
